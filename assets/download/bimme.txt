Hello Sir/Madam,


I have extensive knowledge of HTML5, CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT. Combined with my communication and problem-solving skills, 
I think I would be an excellent candidate for the web developer role.

In my current role as a Junior Web Developer, I design, code, and implement websites for small and medium sized businesses.
Through working collaboratively with design and product teams, I have developed strong communication and teamwork skills.
I can bring my technical skills and passion to your team.

I have always been passionate about Web Development, which led me to pursue a Bachelor of Computer Science degree. 
I am constantly seeking out new technologies and staying up-to-date on trends in the industry, and I would be so thrilled to join 
your team as a Web Developer.

Thank you for taking the time to review my qualifications . I look forward to sharing more about my skills and experiences.

Best Regards,
Bimme Audrey Zun
